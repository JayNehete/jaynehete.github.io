I am a second year MSCS student in [Aggie Graphics Group](https://aggie.graphics/) at Texas A&M University, College Station advised by [Dr. Nima Kalantari](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/index.html). My research interests include computer graphics and 3D vision and areas related to it. Along with this, I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.  
I have been working as a Research Assistant at the Information and Operations Management department at Mays Business School.  
I will be graduating in August 2025 :)
